# Number-recognizer
<p>A very simple neural network that recognizes handwritten numbers from the mnist database.</p>
<p>The neural network is trained on training images and recognizes test images.</p>
<p>The network consists of two layers.</p>

# Requirements
<li><b>keras 2.6.0</b></li>
<li><b>tensorflow 2.6.0</b></li>
<li><b>python 3.9.5(but less is possible)</b></li>

# Running
<p>As a result, the program displays the accuracy with which the network recognized the test images.</p>
